# About AMBA
[AMBA](http://www.ambaforlife.org/) is a Social Enterprise with a mission to economically empower the community of adults (16+) with moderate to severe Intellectual Disability (IQ <65) using Information technology and Peer Training. We have developed an adaptive training methodology to enable these adults to do high quality and accurate back office VISUAL data entry for Mainstream Industries like Telecommunication, Hospitality, Insurance etc. AMBA partners with special institutions, special educators and employs the use of peer trainers (other adults with intellectual disability) to foster a supportive and encouraging environment. We work towards building an ecosystem of learning and earning for these individuals, giving them the dignity and Independence that they deserve. The impact over the last ten years however has been way beyond economic empowerment, eradicating stigma and uplifting a community that felt they had been left behind.
